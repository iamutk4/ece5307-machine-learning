Lab assignments from class ECE-5307, Fall 2022, OSU

This repository contains 10 folders, consisting of 9 weekly lab assignments and1 final project. Each lab assignment folder (lab 1 - lab 9) contains the input data (if any) and code (.ipynb file).

Topic of discussion in each folder is given as follows:

1. Lab 1: Simple Linear Regression on Boston Housing Data

2. Lab 2: Multiple Linear Regression for Robot Calibration

3. Lab 3: Polynomial Regression and model order selection for Ames Iowa housing data

4. Lab 4: Perform LASSA and Ridge regression, select regularization level via cross-validation on a real EEG dataset

5. Lab 5: Multi-class Logistic Regression for gene expression data, confusion matrix, and L1 regularization

6. Lab 6: Nonlinear Least-Squares for Modeling Materials, implement gradient descent and momentum gradient descent, and visualize convergence

7. Lab 7: Digit recognition on EMNIST dataset using SVM with GridSearchCV method

8. Lab 8: Neural Networks for Music Classification using PyTorch package

9. Lab 9: Transfer Learning with a Pre-Trained Deep Neural Network by building a custom image dataset and fine tuning the final layers of an existing deep neural network for a new classification task
